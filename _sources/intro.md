# Getting started with Dfs files in Python using MIKE IO

## Why use MIKE IO?

* You use Python for programming or data analysis
* You are a MIKE modeler with knowledge of the Python libraries NumPy and Pandas

## What are my expected outcomes?

* Read, write and analyse dfs0, dfs1, dfs2, dfs3, dfsu and mesh files
* Utilise data processing and visualisation via Python data science ecosystem
* Convert data to/from 3rd party data formats
* Facilitate scripting and automation of water modelling workflows
* Read and write dfs files using a simple syntax with MIKE Core SDK backend
